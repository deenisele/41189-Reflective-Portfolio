# My Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1 

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we were introduced to the concepts of "systems" and its applications to the everyday world. The lecturer also discussed the different types of systems according to their complexities. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Alot has been learnt during this lesson. Concepts such as "complex adaptive systems" and complicated systems was an important concept that i have learned. 
* Systems are everywhere and are compromised of elements and parts that perform functions (have a relationshi with each other) and work interdependently to form a system. 
* Open, closed and isolated systems: Open systems are able to transfer both amtter and energy across its boundary (e.g. ecosystems); Closed systems can transfer energy only to its surrounding environment; Isolated systems have no interactions to its environment e.g. lab experiments
* Idea of containing systems: Systems **WITHIN** a system (are dependent on each other)
* System **OF** Systems: Systems made up of other systems (independent of each other) 
* Complicated systems: Has many parts and the relationship is static(detailed and preciselt put together) e.g. a microprocessor
* Complex systems: Ahs a dynamic complexity which is not designed by anyone however the parts are in a dynamic reltionship e.g. Our economy: we are not in fixed relationships but have a relationship with each other in regard to economics 

### What insights have I gained?
The concepts of systems can be ambiguous and subjective, as long as we are able to solidly justify that it has parts and the parts work together and have a relationship. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
One of my strengths that i have so far observed is that i am able to take down essential notes that have been said however in regard to weakness, i am unable to maintin focus during lectures and also find it hard understanding concepts and how they link together.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
One main challenge was the initial introduction of the subject. I did not understand what the subject was about and the purpose of this subject. It was more of just learning concepts and no overall goal of this topic. I have handled this by looking into this subject further and looking at the future models to grasp what this subject aims to do.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would pay attention in class more and participate, especially when concepts are unknown. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of "coplex adaptive systems" provided to be useful. Complex Adaptive Systems are systems that are able to adapt and change their behaviour to improve their chances of success. the concepts of self-organisation and emergence was also linked to this theory which provided useful and knowledgable. 



## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
Week two i learnt about models, and their imporatance and use in the real world. Such uses include the 7 uses of models (reason, explain, design, communicate, act and predict). Different approaches to models were also taught and how they are able to assist us in understanding and communicate complex concepts (simplification) to ourselves and other arounds us. Different theories of modelling was also learnt however will dicussed in the next question
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Before participating in this lesson, i did not now the different theorems.
* Condorcet Jury Theorem: Theory that given a group of people indpendently choosing a correct outcome with probability 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and the probability of the incorrect on being 1-p. i.e. Tells us why constructing multiple models will be more accurate
*If p > 0.5 (more likely to be correct), adding more voters will increase the p that voters choose correctly as the p moves towards 1
* If p < 0.5 (voters less likely to vote incorrectly than correctly), adding more voters decreases the p that majority voters choose correctly = more likely to get a correct decision with jury sized 1


* Diversity Prediction Theory: Attempts to predict how accurate crowds will be act predicting. This requires crowd diversity (in views, variables, etc.) and individual accuracy
** if the average individual error is low then there is no point of this cause individuals would be better off by themselves than a group

### What insights have I gained?
Some insights gained during this lesson includes the  use of models and how they apply to the world. More specifically, how they are applied in depth and the contexts to which they need to be applied. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Currently, my strengths and weaknesses remain fairly the same however i still find it difficult to understand some concepts, especially the theorems and how they apply to modelling. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges include paying attention in class. I have a very small attention span and find it difficult to grasp what the tutor is saying. Engaging in class and contacting my teammates has also been somewhat difficult
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time i would continute to try and focus in class whilst also ensuring that i understand all the concepts and being able to provide examples for all the materials learnt in class. I expect better results next lesson by being able to explain my lessons more in depth and without looking at my notes constantly. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Overall, alot was useful. Particularly the use of models to make prediction and how the "condorcet Jury Theorem" and the "Diversity Prediction theory" linked to how models are used. 



## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
This week explain the supermarket of models which basically gave me a background to the following weeks. This included different types of models, decision-making, signaling and models of value and power. In regard to models, there are three types:
	* Rational actor: Assuming people have an objective and the need to maximise value i.e. the most logical and rational choice (usually instinct)
	* Behavioural model: Subjective and bias as gains and losses are perceived differently 
	* Rule-based models: can use a single fixed  rule and usually the easiest to present. 
Decision making was also taught however will be discussed in the next question. 

### What do I now know that I did not before?
During the lesson I found 'signaling' to be the most intriguing as I have not learnt it before. It was a common theory that I have never learnt in depth to which I never knew that there were different ways and approaches to signaling. These type of models identify the conditions that individuals send important signals to reveal information about themselves which ultimately assists in modelling. Both discrete and continuous modelling aim to be as functional as possible and contains important information on how individuals express their actions and messages

### What insights have I gained?
Such insights include how the behaviour of individuals hold different importance. This is applicable to signalling where even the thoughts and behaviours of others hold various outcomes to different degrees. This was also true for the models of value and power where there needed to be a deep analysis of actors contributions, where again, all provided different outcomes depending on certain factors.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths this week were that I was able to maintain focus on the topic and work at own pace. Weaknesses include my lack of contribution to the class. 
### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
A challenged faced this week was once again understanding the content. Though I have learnt a lot, it took me more than the lesson to grasp certain theories and how they can be applied to the real-world. 

### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
Next time, of course it would be to ask more questions in class and also watch the additional videos attached to the pre work

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Theory this week was that people act in many different ways which include modelling people as well as how they convey their actions and behaviour through their signalling



## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
This week discussed three main models within the 'supermarket of models'. The first was system dynamic models which analyses systems with feedbacks and interdependencies which also included casual loop diagrams (represent the relationships between a number of variables). Networks was also taught and different types of networks and how the nodes interact with each other.  The last model is the Agent based model that analyses how an agents behaviour applies to its environment, subject to different rules.
System dynamic models consist of: sources, sinks stock, flow, rates and constants to build 'what-if' experiments and recognise different structures and within the model and look at different scenarios i.e. what ifs. 
Networks are a visual demonstration on an environment to which consists of nodes and edges. There are several structures to networks and different path lengths and 'connectedness'  which can determine the relationships between nodes.

### What do I now know that I did not before?
What I did not know before was the system dynamics model. I did not know it consisted of so many factors and elements to which all influence certain outcomes and situations. In my opinion it is one of the most interesting models and has the potential to become complicated as most situations have a lot of 'what if' situations.
### What insights have I gained?
The main insight for this week is based on Agent Based modelling. This enable me to understand more about how these models can be applied more commonly to society, especially most recently for Covid-19. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week I perceived as my strongest week. I understood the content well and was able to also convey that in my notes. 
### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
No challenges were faced this week. 
### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
N/A
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The most useful theory was the ABS model where it provided a theory where models consisting of autonomous interacting agents may affect others around it. It was the most useful one as it applies to the most recent cases i.e. COVID where it allows for the understanding of how 'agents' all have their own objectives and how those objectives may change according to its environment and rules, and also can affect the other agents around it. 



## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
This week was centralised on aggregating decisions and behaviour which I understood as "decisions and behaviour as a whole (population). This was different from the previous weeks topic where instead it focuses on elements as a whole population. This is so we can predict points (make inferences) and understand data.
This included probability distributions, normal distributions. Long tailed and linear models. These all use random variables (continuous and discrete) to allow us to generalise an outcome or behaviour. This also uses a sample (bigger sample size the better) to make an inference on an entire population. 

### What do I now know that I did not before?
This week I learnt most of the content in a previous subject however I mostly learnt about the extremes: long tailed distributions and how they contribute to 'power plays". This also relates to the previous topic on networks: preferential attachment and the power laws.

### What insights have I gained?
Certain distributions will allow for the understanding of a situation as to why it is important to choose the right distribution model application or else it will not convey the most efficient information to understand.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths this week was that I already know all the content. I  understood the technical words as ive learnt this topic before, however will the addition to how it applies to systems and the analysis of a situation 

### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
The challenges for this week was to contact me team members and finding the most convenient time to meet up and discuss the assignment. This was not handled till the next week

### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
Better communication with my team and be more firm and direct. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that these models can predict certain outcomes using statistics and probability of a random variable. 



## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we discussed various theories and types of models, including the Markov Process/model, random walk and path dependence. This was based on how systems evolve 

### What do I now know that I did not before?
 The main takeaway from this lesson was based on the Markov models. These models are able to capture systems that can transition between a finite of states using various probabilities. They can only be in one state at a time can will eventually transition from one state to another. The transitions depend on the present state and not the history. An example that I found the most easiest to understand was the weather model. If it is raining currently then there are different probabilities for the system to transition into another state: raining, sunny, windy, etc. 
With path dependence, it also applies at current situations where the preceding moments also depend on the current state. The outcome of probabilities depend on the sequence of the past outcomes and can also be sensitive to other conditions/parameters. Some forms of dependence depend on the past outcomes (PHAT) and other depend on the sequence of past outcomes. 
Random walks models takes a number of equal successive steps that are all completely random.

### What insights have I gained?
Such insights I have gained is that there are several paths to take and are dependent on how such systems change and evolve over time, depending on the past/previous state. This can be applied historically (hierarchical structures in society) and also currently (e.g. weather) 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
The strengths for this week was that I was able to understand the concept of these models and how it could be applied to the real world. I however did find some difficulties in understanding the pre-work which were not fully mentioned in the class. 

### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
Some challenges this week was communication between my group. This was handled over time and we clearly stated what was expected of us. 

### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
Next time, I would attend his class. It was extremely insightful however the questions I had could not be answered however over watching the tutorial recordings, some other students asked interesting questions which also reinforced by understanding

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The Markov model was the most useful in my opinion. It was able to capture the transition of systems between a finite number of states where it allowed us to look at these models in different situations and states to analyse and understand their behaviour. 




## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?
This week was about complexity and emergent behaviour. This included the three emergent behaviours: Peer effects and social changes, Coordination and culture, and social learning

### What do I now know that I did not before?
Peer effects and social changes can influence ones behaviour and how they make decisions. This is prominent in fashion, smoking, choice in phones, etc. This can be modelled through Schelling's Segregation Model,  Granovetter's Riot Model and the Standing Ovation Model
Schelling's model concerns itself with how people have some sort of preference towards their group, which can lead to a from of segregation. I.e. Race in society. This also uses a Agent based model to analyse the behaviours of the agents to understand the outcome and come up with a reasoning
Granovetter's Model shows collective behaviour. E.g. if a group of people riot they are demonstrating a collective behaviour and can influence others to behave the same
Standing ovation model  illustrates a behaviour where in a situation of a performance, every member of the audience must decide to join the other standing individuals in their ovation, or if everyone else will remain seated
As for Culture and coordination: There are several meanings to this concept which can be broadly justified. This is manily what environment an individual is in and how it "works" i.e. culture. Culture is consistent coordination. 
Replicator dynamics are a form of social learning model that uses psychology and ecology. It analyses the probability of taking a certain action according to popularity and is done through observing others behaviour.

### What insights have I gained?
These models can be adjustable and are also able to stimulate contagion e.g. COVID. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strengths this week were not noted. Weaknesses however was that I was unable to understand the content without the prework. 

### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
This week was somewhat difficult. I was unable to properly understand the content without doing the prework. After the class I was able to conduct further studying by looking at the prework and what I learnt in class that day

### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
Do the prework.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Granovetters model provided most useful. With consideration of my assignment topic: COVID, this provided useful to which we were able to understand an individuals collective behaviour toward "not getting vaccinations'. 


## Week 8

### What have I learnt this week?
This was a continuation of the previous week. This included new theories such as the Colonel Blotto Game, Cooperation (prisoner's dilemma and collective action problems, along with real life examples

### What do I now know that I did not before?
The entirety of this lesson was new, as to why everything in this lesson was a component that I now know but did not know before. 
The Colonel Blotto game is a game that predicts the winners and losers based on the allocation of resources. Each front is won by the player that has the most resources and the overall game is won by the player who wins the most fronts (rounds). This can be applied to various situations as the behaviours within this game have been relevant to everyday applications such as political, social and other competitive situations (e.g. like war and front lines). This is so we can understand patterns in wins and also test the outcomes with different resource assignments. People with the least resources don’t necessarily guarantee a loss. It depends on strategy and how resources are allocated.
Prisoners Dilemma also models a complex form of behaviour and outcomes: whether the players cooperate or defect with the consideration of a reward. This can be seen in price competition, technological adoption or political campaigns. The most desirable outcome is when all players coordinate to get the highest collaborate payoff/reward. 
Collection Action problems are situations where all players would be better off cooperating but fail in doing so because of conflicting interests and objectives that ultimately discourage collaboration. 

### What insights have I gained?
Such insights gained are the real world applications of these models/theories. It  explains the behaviour of others with the consideration of a players motive and the reward system. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths for this week that I have observed it that I was able to understand this content easily and was able to reword this into my notes in a way that is more understandable. 

### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
The challenges for this week was based on the assignment, There was difficulty in choosing whether we should to the coding or non-coding option. This was resolved through identifying each others strengths and ensuring that each member of the group can do the work. 

### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
Next time, I would cooperate more and use better communication.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that provided useful is the Prison Dilemma. It explained a common behaviour that is not only relevant in a prison setting but also in todays world. I would however like to understand more about this dilemma as I believe that sometimes the efficient outcome may not necessarily be TT. If all prisoners were to cooperate they might also suffer the repercussions e.g. if one snitches and gets released early, there might be consequences on the outside world where other criminals might have 'connections'….etc.

## Individual Reflection on Group Assignment
My contribution for this model included the analysis of the three models (3.1) and the SIR model in 3.2, as well as 1.1 which was the introduction to our assignment and problem area. This included explaining the premise of these models and their application. Samuel completed 2.1 and 2.2 of the assignment, Arjun did 3.2 and Vinh completed 2.3 and 2.4 which showcased the current models in use and some of their implications. As for the coding area, Vinh and Arjun took the initiative to do that section as Sam and I did not have know background knowledge in coding.

In this project I have learnt how to apply certain models in the supermarket to a real-life situation, especially with the ability to choose our own topic, it was more encouraging to properly apply these models. Not only have I learnt from this subject, but I have also learnt from my team members through their own knowledge of this course. The challenges during this assignment were mainly from the lack of communication. There was poor accountability as meetings were not solidified and often forgotten and so were did not communicate as much as we would have liked. Eventually we overcame this issue eventually though our own self-will and eventually worked well together. 

If I am dealing with a real-world problem and had to choose an appropriate model, I would first identify what I would like to know/understand, whether this was to predict, reason, explain, design, communicate or explore the problem. I would then identify the elements of my population and how they behave, whether it is them making decisions, interacting with other elements, or interacting with the environment around them. Choosing a model depends on what type of information one would want to receive and what they plan to do with it. For example, if I wanted to make a inference on a population using probability, I would use any of the aggregating decision models, where as if I wanted to find an elements interaction with other elements, it would be one of the representing system models. Every model can be complex and flexible, it just depends on what parameters are used and how they are applied in that problem solution context.
