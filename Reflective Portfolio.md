# My Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1 

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we were introduced to the concepts of "systems" and its applications to the everyday world. The lecturer also discussed the different types of systems according to their complexities. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Alot has been learnt during this lesson. Concepts such as "complex adaptive systems" and complicated systems was an important concept that i have learned. 
* Systems are everywhere and are compromised of elements and parts that perform functions (have a relationshi with each other) and work interdependently to form a system. 
* Open, closed and isolated systems: Open systems are able to transfer both amtter and energy across its boundary (e.g. ecosystems); Closed systems can transfer energy only to its surrounding environment; Isolated systems have no interactions to its environment e.g. lab experiments
* Idea of containing systems: Systems **WITHIN** a system (are dependent on each other)
* System **OF** Systems: Systems made up of other systems (independent of each other) 
* Complicated systems: Has many parts and the relationship is static(detailed and preciselt put together) e.g. a microprocessor
* Complex systems: Ahs a dynamic complexity which is not designed by anyone however the parts are in a dynamic reltionship e.g. Our economy: we are not in fixed relationships but have a relationship with each other in regard to economics 

### What insights have I gained?
The concepts of systems can be ambiguous and subjective, as long as we are able to solidly justify that it has parts and the parts work together and have a relationship. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
One of my strengths that i have so far observed is that i am able to take down essential notes that have been said however in regard to weakness, i am unable to maintin focus during lectures and also find it hard understanding concepts and how they link together.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
One main challenge was the initial introduction of the subject. I did not understand what the subject was about and the purpose of this subject. It was more of just learning concepts and no overall goal of this topic. I have handled this by looking into this subject further and looking at the future models to grasp what this subject aims to do.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would pay attention in class more and participate, especially when concepts are unknown. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of "coplex adaptive systems" provided to be useful. Complex Adaptive Systems are systems that are able to adapt and change their behaviour to improve their chances of success. the concepts of self-organisation and emergence was also linked to this theory which provided useful and knowledgable.
