# My Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1 

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we were introduced to the concepts of "systems" and its applications to the everyday world. The lecturer also discussed the different types of systems according to their complexities. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Alot has been learnt during this lesson. Concepts such as "complex adaptive systems" and complicated systems was an important concept that i have learned. 
* Systems are everywhere and are compromised of elements and parts that perform functions (have a relationshi with each other) and work interdependently to form a system. 
* Open, closed and isolated systems: Open systems are able to transfer both amtter and energy across its boundary (e.g. ecosystems); Closed systems can transfer energy only to its surrounding environment; Isolated systems have no interactions to its environment e.g. lab experiments
* Idea of containing systems: Systems **WITHIN** a system (are dependent on each other)
* System **OF** Systems: Systems made up of other systems (independent of each other) 
* Complicated systems: Has many parts and the relationship is static(detailed and preciselt put together) e.g. a microprocessor
* Complex systems: Ahs a dynamic complexity which is not designed by anyone however the parts are in a dynamic reltionship e.g. Our economy: we are not in fixed relationships but have a relationship with each other in regard to economics 

### What insights have I gained?
The concepts of systems can be ambiguous and subjective, as long as we are able to solidly justify that it has parts and the parts work together and have a relationship. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
One of my strengths that i have so far observed is that i am able to take down essential notes that have been said however in regard to weakness, i am unable to maintin focus during lectures and also find it hard understanding concepts and how they link together.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
One main challenge was the initial introduction of the subject. I did not understand what the subject was about and the purpose of this subject. It was more of just learning concepts and no overall goal of this topic. I have handled this by looking into this subject further and looking at the future models to grasp what this subject aims to do.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would pay attention in class more and participate, especially when concepts are unknown. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of "coplex adaptive systems" provided to be useful. Complex Adaptive Systems are systems that are able to adapt and change their behaviour to improve their chances of success. the concepts of self-organisation and emergence was also linked to this theory which provided useful and knowledgable. 



## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
Week two i learnt about models, and their imporatance and use in the real world. Such uses include the 7 uses of models (reason, explain, design, communicate, act and predict). Different approaches to models were also taught and how they are able to assist us in understanding and communicate complex concepts (simplification) to ourselves and other arounds us. Different theories of modelling was also learnt however will dicussed in the next question
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Before participating in this lesson, i did not now the different theorems.
* Condorcet Jury Theorem: Theory that given a group of people indpendently choosing a correct outcome with probability 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and the probability of the incorrect on being 1-p. i.e. Tells us why constructing multiple models will be more accurate
*If p > 0.5 (more likely to be correct), adding more voters will increase the p that voters choose correctly as the p moves towards 1
* If p < 0.5 (voters less likely to vote incorrectly than correctly), adding more voters decreases the p that majority voters choose correctly = more likely to get a correct decision with jury sized 1


* Diversity Prediction Theory: Attempts to predict how accurate crowds will be act predicting. This requires crowd diversity (in views, variables, etc.) and individual accuracy
** if the average individual error is low then there is no point of this cause individuals would be better off by themselves than a group

### What insights have I gained?
Some insights gained during this lesson includes the  use of models and how they apply to the world. More specifically, how they are applied in depth and the contexts to which they need to be applied. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Currently, my strengths and weaknesses remain fairly the same however i still find it difficult to understand some concepts, especially the theorems and how they apply to modelling. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges include paying attention in class. I have a very small attention span and find it difficult to grasp what the tutor is saying. Engaging in class and contacting my teammates has also been somewhat difficult
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time i would continute to try and focus in class whilst also ensuring that i understand all the concepts and being able to provide examples for all the materials learnt in class. I expect better results next lesson by being able to explain my lessons more in depth and without looking at my notes constantly. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Overall, alot was useful. Particularly the use of models to make prediction and how the "condorcet Jury Theorem" and the "Diversity Prediction theory" linked to how models are used.
