# My Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1 

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we were introduced to the concepts of "systems" and its applications to the everyday world. The lecturer also discussed the different types of systems according to their complexities. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Alot has been learnt during this lesson. Concepts such as "complex adaptive systems" and complicated systems was an important concept that i have learned. 
* Systems are everywhere and are compromised of elements and parts that perform functions (have a relationshi with each other) and work interdependently to form a system. 
* Open, closed and isolated systems: Open systems are able to transfer both amtter and energy across its boundary (e.g. ecosystems); Closed systems can transfer energy only to its surrounding environment; Isolated systems have no interactions to its environment e.g. lab experiments
* Idea of containing systems: Systems **WITHIN** a system (are dependent on each other)
* System **OF** Systems: Systems made up of other systems (independent of each other) 
* Complicated systems: Has many parts and the relationship is static(detailed and preciselt put together) e.g. a microprocessor
* Complex systems: Ahs a dynamic complexity which is not designed by anyone however the parts are in a dynamic reltionship e.g. Our economy: we are not in fixed relationships but have a relationship with each other in regard to economics 

### What insights have I gained?
The concepts of systems can be ambiguous and subjective, as long as we are able to solidly justify that it has parts and the parts work together and have a relationship. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
One of my strengths that i have so far observed is that i am able to take down essential notes that have been said however in regard to weakness, i am unable to maintin focus during lectures and also find it hard understanding concepts and how they link together.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
One main challenge was the initial introduction of the subject. I did not understand what the subject was about and the purpose of this subject. It was more of just learning concepts and no overall goal of this topic. I have handled this by looking into this subject further and looking at the future models to grasp what this subject aims to do.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would pay attention in class more and participate, especially when concepts are unknown. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of "coplex adaptive systems" provided to be useful. Complex Adaptive Systems are systems that are able to adapt and change their behaviour to improve their chances of success. the concepts of self-organisation and emergence was also linked to this theory which provided useful and knowledgable. 



## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
Week two i learnt about models, and their imporatance and use in the real world. Such uses include the 7 uses of models (reason, explain, design, communicate, act and predict). Different approaches to models were also taught and how they are able to assist us in understanding and communicate complex concepts (simplification) to ourselves and other arounds us. Different theories of modelling was also learnt however will dicussed in the next question
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Before participating in this lesson, i did not now the different theorems.
* Condorcet Jury Theorem: Theory that given a group of people indpendently choosing a correct outcome with probability 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and the probability of the incorrect on being 1-p. i.e. Tells us why constructing multiple models will be more accurate
*If p > 0.5 (more likely to be correct), adding more voters will increase the p that voters choose correctly as the p moves towards 1
* If p < 0.5 (voters less likely to vote incorrectly than correctly), adding more voters decreases the p that majority voters choose correctly = more likely to get a correct decision with jury sized 1


* Diversity Prediction Theory: Attempts to predict how accurate crowds will be act predicting. This requires crowd diversity (in views, variables, etc.) and individual accuracy
** if the average individual error is low then there is no point of this cause individuals would be better off by themselves than a group

### What insights have I gained?
Some insights gained during this lesson includes the  use of models and how they apply to the world. More specifically, how they are applied in depth and the contexts to which they need to be applied. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Currently, my strengths and weaknesses remain fairly the same however i still find it difficult to understand some concepts, especially the theorems and how they apply to modelling. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges include paying attention in class. I have a very small attention span and find it difficult to grasp what the tutor is saying. Engaging in class and contacting my teammates has also been somewhat difficult
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time i would continute to try and focus in class whilst also ensuring that i understand all the concepts and being able to provide examples for all the materials learnt in class. I expect better results next lesson by being able to explain my lessons more in depth and without looking at my notes constantly. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Overall, alot was useful. Particularly the use of models to make prediction and how the "condorcet Jury Theorem" and the "Diversity Prediction theory" linked to how models are used. 



## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
This week explain the supermarket of models which basically gave me a background to the following weeks. This included different types of models, decision-making, signaling and models of value and power. In regard to models, there are three types:
	* Rational actor: Assuming people have an objective and the need to maximise value i.e. the most logical and rational choice (usually instinct)
	* Behavioural model: Subjective and bias as gains and losses are perceived differently 
	* Rule-based models: can use a single fixed  rule and usually the easiest to present. 
Decision making was also taught however will be discussed in the next question. 

### What do I now know that I did not before?
During the lesson I found 'signaling' to be the most intriguing as I have not learnt it before. It was a common theory that I have never learnt in depth to which I never knew that there were different ways and approaches to signaling. These type of models identify the conditions that individuals send important signals to reveal information about themselves which ultimately assists in modelling. Both discrete and continuous modelling aim to be as functional as possible and contains important information on how individuals express their actions and messages

### What insights have I gained?
Such insights include how the behaviour of individuals hold different importance. This is applicable to signalling where even the thoughts and behaviours of others hold various outcomes to different degrees. This was also true for the models of value and power where there needed to be a deep analysis of actors contributions, where again, all provided different outcomes depending on certain factors.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths this week were that I was able to maintain focus on the topic and work at own pace. Weaknesses include my lack of contribution to the class. 
### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
A challenged faced this week was once again understanding the content. Though I have learnt a lot, it took me more than the lesson to grasp certain theories and how they can be applied to the real-world. 

### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
Next time, of course it would be to ask more questions in class and also watch the additional videos attached to the pre work

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Theory this week was that people act in many different ways which include modelling people as well as how they convey their actions and behaviour through their signalling



## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
This week discussed three main models within the 'supermarket of models'. The first was system dynamic models which analyses systems with feedbacks and interdependencies which also included casual loop diagrams (represent the relationships between a number of variables). Networks was also taught and different types of networks and how the nodes interact with each other.  The last model is the Agent based model that analyses how an agents behaviour applies to its environment, subject to different rules.
System dynamic models consist of: sources, sinks stock, flow, rates and constants to build 'what-if' experiments and recognise different structures and within the model and look at different scenarios i.e. what ifs. 
Networks are a visual demonstration on an environment to which consists of nodes and edges. There are several structures to networks and different path lengths and 'connectedness'  which can determine the relationships between nodes.

### What do I now know that I did not before?
What I did not know before was the system dynamics model. I did not know it consisted of so many factors and elements to which all influence certain outcomes and situations. In my opinion it is one of the most interesting models and has the potential to become complicated as most situations have a lot of 'what if' situations.
### What insights have I gained?
The main insight for this week is based on Agent Based modelling. This enable me to understand more about how these models can be applied more commonly to society, especially most recently for Covid-19. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week I perceived as my strongest week. I understood the content well and was able to also convey that in my notes. 
### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
No challenges were faced this week. 
### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
N/A
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The most useful theory was the ABS model where it provided a theory where models consisting of autonomous interacting agents may affect others around it. It was the most useful one as it applies to the most recent cases i.e. COVID where it allows for the understanding of how 'agents' all have their own objectives and how those objectives may change according to its environment and rules, and also can affect the other agents around it. 



## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
This week was centralised on aggregating decisions and behaviour which I understood as "decisions and behaviour as a whole (population). This was different from the previous weeks topic where instead it focuses on elements as a whole population. This is so we can predict points (make inferences) and understand data.
This included probability distributions, normal distributions. Long tailed and linear models. These all use random variables (continuous and discrete) to allow us to generalise an outcome or behaviour. This also uses a sample (bigger sample size the better) to make an inference on an entire population. 

### What do I now know that I did not before?
This week I learnt most of the content in a previous subject however I mostly learnt about the extremes: long tailed distributions and how they contribute to 'power plays". This also relates to the previous topic on networks: preferential attachment and the power laws.

### What insights have I gained?
Certain distributions will allow for the understanding of a situation as to why it is important to choose the right distribution model application or else it will not convey the most efficient information to understand.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths this week was that I already know all the content. I  understood the technical words as ive learnt this topic before, however will the addition to how it applies to systems and the analysis of a situation 

### What were the challenges that I encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them
The challenges for this week was to contact me team members and finding the most convenient time to meet up and discuss the assignment. This was not handled till the next week

### What would I do better next time and with that anticipated results?
Better communication with my team and be more firm and direct. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that these models can predict certain outcomes using statistics and probability of a random variable.
